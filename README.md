# ResNets-and-Transfer-Learning
Training different ResNet Architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset to analyze performance of different optimizers and architectures. Using transfer learning for ResNet 50.

My Test results for the CIFAR-10 dataset were as follows (CIFAR 10.cvs) and the best accuracy was 83.15%
