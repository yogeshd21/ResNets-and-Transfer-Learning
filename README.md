# ResNets-and-Transfer-Learning
Training different ResNet Architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset to analyze performance of different optimizers and architectures. Using transfer learning for ResNet 50.

# ResNet PlayGround
My Test results for the CIFAR-10 dataset were as follows (CIFAR 10.cvs) and the best accuracy was 83.15%

My Test results for the CIFAR-100 dataset were as follows (CIFAR 100.cvs) and the best accuracy was 51.8%

# ResNet50 Transfer Learning
After using the pre-trained ResNet-50 I could get an accuracy of on 70.72 with CIFAR-10 dataset and an accuracy of 53.62 with CIFAR-100 dataset. The performance seems similar to ResNet-20 but may be with some different parameters could have achieved performance as good as the best model cases for ResNet-20.
